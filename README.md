# Shrimp Disease Detection

This project uses TensorFlow to create a model for detecting shrimp diseases from microscope images. The model is deployed on a Flask web application and hosted on Render.

## Features
- **TensorFlow-based model**: Trained to detect healthy and diseased shrimp from microscope images.
- **Flask Web Application**: Allows users to upload microscope shrimp disease images for disease detection.
- **Deployment on Render**: The application is hosted on [Render](https://shrimpclassify.onrender.com/), a platform for deploying web apps.

## Presentation
- **SciEx2025**: Present a poster at The 26th Science Project Exhibition Mahidol University.
- **NAC2025**: Show the website at The 20th NSTDA Annual Conference: NAC2025.
